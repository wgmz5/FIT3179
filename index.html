          <p>But what causes these road crashes in Victoria? The pie chart on the right shows the main types of road crashes. The most prominent being collision with 
          vehicle. As seen from the pie chart, most of these road crashes are caused by human error, colliding with something or someone. While driving on public roads, 
          it is not only essential to follow the road rules, but also to watch out for others who may be breaking rules. Accidents happen. Other people may not be consciously 
          trying to do the wrong thing, but it is inevitable that people make mistakes. As we have all learnt while learning to drive, there are blind spots that the driver 
          is unable to see. Hence, it is essential to be alert and pay attention to those around you.</p>
